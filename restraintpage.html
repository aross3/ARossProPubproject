	<h1>Restraints in JCPS often differ from 'arm hold or bear hug'</h1>

	<p><h4>By Allison Ross</h4></p>
	
	<!-- <p class="ledein">What does it mean when a student is restrained on a Jefferson County Public Schools campus? The Courier-Journal took a look at restraints and seclusions in the month of February 2015 to get a sample of what sorts of restraints are being used on students, when and why.</p> -->

	<p class="explantext">The use of restraints or seclusion in Jefferson County Public Schools has come into increasing focus this year after the revelation that the district had <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2016/03/07/jcps-restrained-thousands-kids-but-didnt-report/81284664/">been severely underreporting the number of cases of such incidents to the state.</a>

	</p>
	<p class="explantext">School districts across Kentucky self-report the number of times restraint and seclusion are used on their campuses, and in JCPS, schools are often left to police themselves about when it should be used and how.</p> 
	<p class="explantext">The use of such measures has become a hot-button issue in recent years in school districts across the country, given evidence of potential abuse of the techniques as well as the possibility for physical and mental harm to children. The Courier-Journal has outlined instances where one <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2016/05/27/jcps-pays-175m-after-boys-legs-broken/84916428/">child's legs were broken during a restraint</a> and another where an <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2016/04/27/jcps-opens-restraint-investigation-teacher/83522256/">elementary student vomited while being held up against a wall.</a></p> 
	<p class="explantext">JCPS Superintendent Donna Hargens recently described restraints to the school board and public as <strong>"an arm hold to a bear hug."</strong> What restraints actually look like can vary, according to a Courier-Journal analysis of restraint and seclusion reports.</p> 

	<h2>Restraint, seclusion used hundreds of times in one month</h2>
	
		<p class="explantext">Of 323 incidents of restraint or seclusion the CJ reviewed from the month of February 2015, more than half included a seated or floor "cradle" restraint -- where a student was either held in a seated position on the floor or was brought to the floor in some position during the cradle restraint.</p>

	<p class="explantext"><em>*Note: Percentages will not add up to 100 percent because many incidents involved multiple restraint or seclusion techniques. Also, only the most commonly used techniques are detailed here, and numbers are rounded to the closest full percent.</em></p>




	<p class="explantext">The CJ's analysis did not include a slew of incidents that school district officials found in a separate -- third -- database while attempting to find all the incidents of restraint and seclusion it is sending to the state.</p>

	<h2>Some restrained for nonviolent incidents</h2>

	<p class="explantext">Kentucky regulations stipulate that physical restraint may only be used if a student's behavior "poses an imminent danger of physical harm to self or others."</p>

	<p class="explantext">A review of district data turned up dozens of incidents from February 2015 where students appeared to have been restrained or secluded for non-violent behaviors such as "refusal to follow directions," "class disruptions" and being out of their assigned area. A JCPS spokeswoman said that school staff may use restraints to force a student out of class if the student is causing "such a disruption that other students cannot learn." </p>

<!-- <p class="totalnum">24 times a day</p>
<p>After combing through and cleaning up its data, JCPS has now told the state there were 4,160 incidents of restraint and/or seclusion in the 2014-2015 school year. About 70 percent of schools conducted at least one restraint, although there was wide variation among schools in how many restraints were reported.</p>
